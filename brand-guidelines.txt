# Prism Labs — Brand Guidelines

---

## 1. Brand Essence

* **Core Idea:** Amplifying Human Intent through AI.
* **Identity:** A fusion of research lab precision and creative studio imagination.
* **Metaphor:** Light refracting through a prism — clarity, amplification, and spectrum.

---

## 2. Brand Voice & Messaging

* **Tone:** Visionary, human-centered, profound.
* **Voice Traits:**

  * Futuristic but warm.
  * Minimal, clear, precise.
  * Philosophical yet grounded.

  * **“Amplifying Human Intent through AI.”**
* **Supporting Lines:**

  * “From complexity to clarity.”
  * “Where vision meets precision.”

## 3. Logo & Mark

* **Concept:** Stylized prism triangle with spectral light beams.
* **Usage:** Always on white background. Clean and minimal.
* **Variations:**

  * Full lockup: Prism icon + wordmark.
  * Icon only: Gradient prism mark.
* **Spacing:** Minimum clear space equal to the height of the prism icon.

## 4. Color Palette

* **Base Colors:**

  * White (#FFFFFF)
  * Graphite Gray (#1E1E1E)
  * Soft Neutral Gray (#F5F5F5)

* **Spectral Accent Gradient:**

  * Sky Blue (#60A5FA)
  * Violet (#A78BFA)
  * Magenta (#F472B6)
  * Amber (#F59E0B)
  * Emerald (#34D399)

* **Usage:** White/gray dominate. Spectral gradient used sparingly as highlights, borders, and animated accents.

## 5. Typography

* **Primary Typeface:** Geometric Sans (e.g., Inter, Söhne, or Neue Haas).

  * Used for headings, hero text, navigation.
* **Secondary Typeface:** Humanist Serif or Mono (e.g., IBM Plex Serif or Space Mono).

  * Used for quotes, supporting details, principles.
* **Style:** Modern, clear, technical with a human edge.

---

## 6. Imagery & Graphics

* **Concepts:** Light beams, prisms, diffraction, glassy structures.
* **Style:** Abstract, minimal, with subtle gradients and soft glows.
* **Photography (if used):** High-contrast, abstract textures (glass, light, reflections).

---

## 7. UI & Digital Language

* **Layout:** Clean white backgrounds, generous spacing.
* **Elements:** Glassmorphism panels, spectral gradient lines.
* **Animations:** Light refraction, beam splitting, spectral reveals.
* **Iconography:** Minimal, line-based, paired with spectral gradient fills.

---

## 8. Brand Applications

* **Website:** Hero section with animated prism refraction, products displayed like modular apps.
* **Decks:** White backgrounds with spectral divider lines.
* **Merch / Print:** Keep clean — prism logo embossed or gradient foil accents.

---

## 9. Principles in Practice

1. **Human at the Core:** Design always emphasizes user agency.
2. **Clarity from Complexity:** Visuals simplify and amplify, not overwhelm.
3. **Rigor × Imagination:** Every element balances lab precision and studio creativity.

---

## 10. Don’ts

* Don’t place the logo on non-white backgrounds.
* Don’t overuse the rainbow spectrum — keep gradients controlled.
* Don’t clutter visuals; embrace minimal space.
